# Hackfrost_Whiteboard
An education whiteboard web app made for the HackFrost competition 2021. \
Note: It can take some time to load since the server goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Project hosted at https://yootboard.herokuapp.com/ \

## How to try it out?
- Open two tabs of the `Try Demo`
- Start drawing on one of them.
- You will notice that the interactions will replicate in the other tab.
- This was a demo used to present our idea to the judges of the hackathon.
